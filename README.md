# Python_Spark_Click-Through-Rate-Prediction
<br />
Synopsis: Click through Rate Prediction with Logistic Regression and Log Loss Models.
<br />
Motivation:  In order to efficiently work with big data different techniques have to be employed.  Sparse Vectors and Feature Hashing are particularly helpful for reducing numerous features or categorical features into manageable formats.  We trained models on a click through rate prediction set with these tools using Logistic Regression and Log Loss Models from MLlib (Part 4).  Feature hashing is utilized to reduce feature dimensionality in Logistic Regression and Log Loss Models from MLlib (Part 5).
